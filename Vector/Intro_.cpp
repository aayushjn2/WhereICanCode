    In this video, we see how to find gcd of two number using inbuilt function
    in c++.
    First lets see what is GCD :
    So, gcd is the largest integer that divides each of the value.
    first we need to include library.
    Gcd is present in library <algorithm>
    Yayyy!!!. Now no need to implement your own function.
